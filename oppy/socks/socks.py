.. topic:: Details

    OppySOCKSProtocol instances handle the initial SOCKS 5 handshake with
    client applications, passing the remote resource request to a stream,
    and then forwarding data back and forth between a circuit and a local
    application.

    An OppySOCKSProtocol instance is assigned to each incoming request on
    the SOCKS port, and upon successful handshake negotiaton a stream is
    created for the client application's request.

    Once the client has made a successful request, this object goes into the
    forwarding state in which it:

        - forwards all subsequent data from the client to the remote resource
          (through a circuit)
        - sends all data written to this object's recv() method to the
          client application

    Throughout this process, this object communicates with the client
    application via transport, as usual for Twisted Protocol objects.
